# Module 2 Challenge

## Background

Steve's parents want to start investing. They decided to put all of their investment money into DAQO before Steve was able to research its value to see if it is investment worthy. Turns out that it is not. DAQO dropped over 63% in 2018. Needless to say, Steve needs to give his parents a better set of stock options. To do this, he asked *me* to create an easy-to-use form for him to analyze stock data from several years.

### Result

The final VBA code automates financial analysis. Steve will be able to click a button, input a year and see all of the information he would need to provide his parents with better investment options compared to DAQO.

In the original VBA code, the buttons only allowed for analysis of 2017 and 2018, which was not going to work for Steve's needs, now that he wants to do more research of several years of stock data. To accommodate his needs, I refactored the code, offering the option to input any year there is data for and it will produce simple, yet insightful data visual- just what Steve needed!
